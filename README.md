# Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classification

My basic task is to create an algorithm to classify whether an image contains a dog or a cat. The input
for this task is images of dogs or cats from training dataset, while the output is the classification accuracy
on test dataset
- Responsibility:1) Explored and research on Cat and Dog data required for Image Classification. 2)Preprocess
the data(Noise Elimination, Edge Detection, Shape Refinement,etc) 3)Initialize the CNN using
Sequential model and make some operations like MaxPooling, Add 2nd Convolutional Layer,Conv2D for
2D image, Flattening and Setting the parameters to characterize the content of an image(rows,columns,
No. of filters,Activation Function) 4)Compile CNN and fitting to images,Prepare Model using train test
data sets. 5)Check the accuracy measures using accuracy, Validation accuracy, Loss, Validation Loss
6)Accuracy measures indicates the model is trained in a good way (It will help for accurate prediction in
Classification of Cat and Dog )
